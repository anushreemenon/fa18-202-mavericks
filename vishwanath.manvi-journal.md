# Weekly Scrum Report:

## Week 1: 11/4 - 11/10:

### What tasks did I work on / complete?
Worked with team to research various games to be implemented. We narrowed down from 4 games to a final one - Crossy Road. I then worked with team to write game requirements in the form of user stories and broke them into tasks and estimated them. This is documented here at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dMe1_Ixf5i2VE0_i3Y-k3izS20wZZ5Eb07uHHIjhDTg/edit#gid=0.

I also picked a XP value of Communication. As part of this value, I facilitated 3 team meetings and ensured team was on the same page.
1. Braining storming session to finalize game and discuss features
2. Sprint planning meeting - User story writeup session
3. Identify design patterns to be implemented

### What am I planning to work on next?
Expand user stories to use case documentation, activity diagram
Design system using UML class diagrams, sequence diagrams
Take up my tasks:
  1. Implement Chain of Responsibility pattern for checking if player is crashing/hitting object
  2. Implement a terrain of the game - River.

### What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
No blockers as of now.
