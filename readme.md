# Game: Crossy World

Crossy World is a new and improved version of classic arcade game - "Frogger". We have greatly improved the game by providing a continous navigation where player keeps crossing multiple terrains till he reaches the finish line. 

## Gameplay:
Cross land, road and river by avoid all obstacles in each of the terrains. Player has 3 lives to begin with. Collect coins to increase score and get more lives. For every 5 coins collected, player gets an additional life. Keep going till you hit the finish line. On hitting finish line, move to next level. In next level, gameplay remains same except the difficulty level increases where number of terrains to cross increases along with cars and logs approach faster.

## A summary of areas of contributions (for each team member)

### Vishwanath Manvi:

1. Pitched multiple game ideas to be implemented including the game we finalized - Crossy World.
2. Helped drive requirements discussion and design and user story creation in the initial phase.
3. Imnplemented 2 feature stories - player crossing river terrains, crashing obstacles
4. Implemented the logic of populating cars and river logs randomly.
5. Implemented 2 design patterns - 
         i. Strategy pattern for handling the game differently for each level. At each game level, the number of terrains, car and log speed changes. Also, strategy pattern can be extended to load each level differently with other terrains (not implemented currently). 
         ii. Prototype pattern for creating objects in the terrains like cars, logs, trees and rocks. So, instead of creating these objects from stratch, am using clone() feature to create more of them.

6. Helped in refactoring code from other modules, testing and fixing issues.
7. As a champion of XP value <b> "Communication" </b>, I was helping with most of the communications with the team that included setting up meetings, communicating updates over slack and whatsapp, taking notes, etc.
